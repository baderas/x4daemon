X4Daemon comes with absolutely no warranty.
A daemon that makes it possible to use all special keys on your Sidewinder X4 keyboard.
It is licensed under the GPL (General Public License), version 2 or later.
Details should be in the src package or at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.

It is not possible to switch banks or to record macros.

Depending on your windowmanager you should be able to define keys somewhere, 
I use S1-S6 and Bank_Switch for switching between my virtual desktops in AwesomeWM, 
which is very nice. I didn't test this in Gnome or KDE, but it should work fine. 
You can check if X4Daemon works correctly with xev. 

I made this package for Archlinux, I tested it on debian, but I didn't test it on any other distros.

Special thanks go to tolga9009 for posting the keycodes on ubuntu forums and on libg15 forums.

You can change the keys in source code, see keys[] array.
(I just used some unused keycodes for the special keys.)
Mute,Prev,Next,PlayPause,VolDown, VolUP and Calc use the same keycodes as before.
See /usr/include/linux/input.h for more information.
If you find any bugs or if you want to tell me something: development AT geekparadise.de.

Known Problems:
- It works fine on virtualbox (stop X4Daemon on the host before trying!) until you want to end X4Daemon. 
X4Daemon then can't release the interface correctly until you disconnect the usb device in virtualbox's 
menu (X4Daemon will hang until you do this). This is not caused by X4Daemon (I think), 
it seem to be some problem with virtualbox's usb drivers.
